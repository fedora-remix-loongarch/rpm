Subject: [PATCH] Fix rpmbuild -br not building .src.rpm regression
 (RhBug:2078744)

Successful rpmbuild -br needs to produce an src.rpm, this was untested
in the testsuite and commit ad8b9bd2ca93cf4319680f056bb40bfc24661991
missed this twist in the logic. Fixing is an obvious one-liner now,
add a test to ensure it doesn't happen again.
